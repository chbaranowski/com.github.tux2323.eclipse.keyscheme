# TUX2323 Key Scheme
#
# This eclipse key scheme extended the eclipse basic key scheme and add key bindings to command without
# a default key binding. 
# 
# Example: STRG+P Show the Perspective View to change to a other perspective.
#
# To ease find the command IDs of a existing command in the eclipse platform there is a small util eclipse plugin,
# the eclipse command viewer http://github.com/tux2323/com.github.tux2323.eclipse.command.viewer
